# Overview
In this project, we investigated the application of Reinforcement Learning for autonomous indoor car navigation within the university campus. The car was constructed using the Waveshare JetRacer Kit, Nvidia Jetson Nano board, RPLidar A3, and Intel D455 camera. The Lidar data collected serves as the agent's state, which is then utilized by the RL model to determine the optimal action for the car in each given state.
To facilitate the training of the RL model, a custom simulator was developed in Python, featuring the floor plan and sensors. The model was trained within this simulation environment using Double Deep Q learning algorithm. The results of the experiment demonstrated the model's proficiency in simulation scenarios. However, in real-world conditions, the model exhibited some challenges in maintaining smooth navigation along a predefined path. Nevertheless, the car successfully demonstrated the capability to navigate and avoid obstacles and walls.
